        "instructions": "For the cupcakes: Preheat the convection oven to 325 degrees F or a standard oven to 350 degrees F.\nIn large mixer bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and butter until light and fluffy with a heavy duty mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the coconut extract and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of flour mixture and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fold in the coconut flakes.\nFill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely.\nFor the mousse filling: In large mixer bowl, beat the heavy cream, half-and-half, coconut extract and pudding mix until light and fluffy using a heavy duty mixer. It should have the consistency of whipped cream. Gently fold in the coconut using a plastic spatula. Put the filling in a pastry bag or zipper bag with a corner cut off.\nFor the coconut buttercream: In large mixer bowl, beat together the butter and half of the powdered sugar using heavy duty mixer. Add the half-and-half and the rest of the powdered sugar, along with the coconut extract, and mix well. If the frosting is thicker than you would like, add 1 teaspoon of additional half-and-half at a time, mixing well after each addition, until the frosting reaches the correct consistency. The thickness may depend on the humidity levels in your region. Put into a pastry bag.\nTo assemble: Make a hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Be sure and leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of the hole. Fill the cupcakes with the mousse filling. Frost with coconut buttercream. You may top the cupcakes with more flake coconut or toasted coconut as desired.\nServe immediately or chill until ready to serve.",

        "instructions": "Cut the tubes into rings. Lightly coat the squid with flour and fry 360 degree F oil until golden brown. We make this pizza the same way as the margarita except that the spicy oil is drizzled on instead of just olive oil and then the calamari is placed on top, and garnished with scallions.\nPrepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals.\nOn a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.\nWhen the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.\nUsing tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nSlide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired.\nPizza Dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls.\nCombine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to very low, and gently simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the flavors continue to infuse the oil as it cools\nStrain the oil into a clean jar. When it has cooled to room temperature, cover and refrigerate.",

Sprinkle in the butter pieces and cut them into the flour with a pastry cutter (or 2 knives or your fingertips) until the mixture is crumbly and the pieces are the size of small peas. Mix in 5 tablespoons very cold water and toss with a fork until the dough just comes together.\nPlace the dough on the floured counter and knead a few times, just to make a ball. Don't overwork the dough or the crust will be tough! Lightly flour the counter. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. (If making more than 1 hour ahead, let it rest on the counter for 10 minutes before rolling out.)\nRoll the dough out on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch pie plate and trim to a 1/2-inch overhang all around. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with a fork or your fingers. Chill the pie shell in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cover the shell with a piece of parchment paper and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on the bottom rack until the crust is set but still blond in color, about 20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans or weights and bake until the crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool completely on a rack.\nFor the custard, in a saucepan, combine the granulated sugar, flour, and salt. Add the milk gradually while stirring. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it begins to bubble. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until it forms firm peaks.\nStir a small amount of the hot milk mixture into the beaten egg yolks in a small bowl. This will temper the yolks so they don't turn into scrambled eggs. Stir the tempered yolks back into the rest of the custard. Cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Slice 2 bananas into the cooled pastry crust. Top with half of the custard and slice the remaining bananas on top. Top with the rest of the custard. Chill for at least 1 hour.\nFor the whipped cream, in a cold bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until firm peaks form. Be careful not to overbeat or your cream will turn to butter. Watch as you beat and stop when it gets thick and stays on the beaters when you remove them from the bowl.\nTop the pie with the whipped cream and serve.",

Using the paddle of an electric mixer or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter and shortening until mixture resembles \"small peas.\" Pour the vanilla extract over the dough. Pour ice water, a little at a time, over the dough, and mix lightly until the dough comes together. Separate dough into 2 pieces and flatten each piece like a pancake. Wrap each piece of dough separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nFor Pie Filling:\nCombine rhubarb and strawberries in a big bowl. Combine sugar, flour and scraped vanilla bean seeds and mix in with fruit mixture. Let sit while rolling pie dough.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch glass pie plate. Roll 1/2 pie dough to approximately 1/8-inch thick and about 1 inch larger than the pie plate. Fit in into the pie pan leaving the overlap intact. Fill with fruit filling and dot top with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Brush beaten egg with pastry brush around the rim of the pie. Roll out the remaining dough and make a lattice top. Crimp the edges. Brush lattice with beaten egg. Do not brush the edge of the pie--this will cause the dough to become too dark while baking. Generously sprinkle with crystal sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for an additional hour. Pie is done when golden brown and juices bubbling from pie appear thickened."

Add rice, stirring until each grain is coated with oil. Add about 3/4 cup simmering stock and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the stock is absorbed. Continue adding stock, 3/4 cup at a time, still stirring constantly and letting each batch be absorbed before adding the next, until about 1/2 of the stock is remaining. Reduce the heat to moderate, if necessary to keep the risotto at a simmer. Continue adding the stock in the same manner until the rice is tender and creamy looking but still al dente, about 20 minutes.\nReduce the heat to low, add the butter then the cheeses. Mix well. Add the spinach and the lemon juice and continue mixing. Remove from the heat and keep warm.\nIn a heavy-bottomed frying pan, heat the canola oil and saute the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and immediately add the ouzo and light it. Let the flame subside. Season the shrimp with salt, and pepper, and set aside.\nGarnish each portion of the risotto with grilled shrimp, parsley, lemon zest, and feta cheese.\nTo make veal stock:\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\nRemove meat from bones where possible and cut into 1-inch pieces. If using breast bones, cut apart. In roasting pan, arrange bones and meat in 1 layer, drizzle with oil, season with salt, and pepper and roast in lower part of the oven, stirring half way in between until bones are golden brown, 40 minutes to 1 hour depending on the size of the bones. Add the tomato paste by spooning it over the bones. Add the vegetables and put it in the oven for an additional hour.\nInto a large stockpot, add bones, meat, roasted vegetables, herbs, and 16 cups (4 L) water. Discard fat from roasting pan. Place tray back onto the stovetop. Heat on medium for about 1 minute then remove. Immediately add 1/2 cup to 1 cup water to the pan, scraping up brown bits, put the tray back on heat and then add the deglazed liquid to the stockpot. Bring liquid to a tremble, about 190 degrees F, and cook at 190 degrees F (skim froth frequently during first hour of cooking) for 8 hours.\nPour stock in batches through a large fine sieve and discard solids. Skim off fat. (Alternatively, cool stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Scrape congealed fat from chilled stock.) Gently simmer stock, skimming froth occasionally, until reduced to about 4 cups (1 L), about 1 hour. Cool stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week or, frozen in airtight containers, 3 months. If desired, pour cooled stock into ice-cube trays with 1-ounce cups and freeze. Frozen cubes keep in heavy-duty sealable plastic bags 3 months.",

        "instructions": "Make the dough: Put 2 1/4 cups warm (100 degrees F) water in a large measuring cup; stir in the yeast to dissolve, then stir in the sugar and olive oil. Let stand until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine 5 cups flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast mixture and mix on medium-low speed, adding a little more flour or water, if needed, until a rough, sticky ball of dough forms, about 1 minute. Let rest 5 minutes, then mix on medium low until no longer sticky, about 1 more minute. Transfer the dough to an oiled surface and knead with oiled hands until smooth, about 10 times. Let rest 5 minutes, then knead briefly again and transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Divide the dough into 4 balls, dust with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours before making the pizzas.\nMake the sauce: Crush the tomatoes in a bowl using your hands. Stir in the olive oil, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the oregano. Cover and let stand 2 hours. Position a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat to 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a 12-to-14-inch round on individual sheets of parchment paper. Let rest 15 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the sauce. Spread a thin layer of sauce on each pizza, leaving a border. Top with one-quarter each of the mozzarella, parmesan, cherry peppers, soppressata and radicchio; drizzle with olive oil. Slide 1 pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone in the oven. Bake until the crust browns, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with oregano.

Ask for the chine bone which will be used to roast the meat on to avoid burning the bottom. In a saucepan over medium heat combine the pureed Ancho chili, tomato puree, honey, vinegar, Worcestershire, black pepper, ground cumin and garlic. Bring the ingredients to a simmer and allow to cook for 20 minutes before removing from the heat and adding the bourbon.\nSeason the roast with salt and pepper and brush with Ancho marinade. Place the chine bone in a roasting pan and place the pork roast on the bones: this will prevent the bottom of the roast from burning. Place the roasting pan into the oven and cook for 20 minutes before turning the heat down to 350 degrees F. Brush the roast at frequent intervals during the cooking process to keep the roast moist as well as perfumed with the spice mixture. Add the roughly cut vegetables and continue to cook until the roast reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove the roast from the pan and allow to stand for 20 minutes before carving. While the roast is resting make the quick pan gravy by pouring off all of the rendered pork fat, leaving the rough cut vegetables in the pan. Place the roasting pan on the stove top, turn the burner on underneath the roasting pan and continue to cook the vegetables with the chine bone. Carefully deglaze the pan by adding the wine allowing most of the liquid to cook off before adding the hot chicken broth, reducing the heat to a simmer. Meanwhile in a small saucepan combine the 3 tablespoons of pork fat with the flour and cook gently to make a light brown roux, cooking about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a wire whisk, add the roux to the simmering stock and whip the ingredients together to avoid lumping. Add any remaining marinade to the gravy, then cook for 5 minutes before straining through a fine mesh strainer.\nServe the roast, by carving at the table, with the dressing and gravy on the side.",
